# Runs INSIDE the reused CI SIF (apptainer exec). $1 = python version.
#
# The SIF (~/.scitex/dev/containers/ci-cpu.sif, on punim0264) bakes the curated
# ecosystem dependency union — the scientific core (numpy/scipy/pandas/
# matplotlib/torch/…), the scitex basics (io/logging/config/dict/decorators/
# gen/nn/stats/str/dsp), scitex-dev[all,dev], figrecipe, and the pytest
# toolchain — FULLY installed in a per-version venv at /opt/venv-$V. It is
# READ-ONLY, so CI runs the CHECKOUT's code by prepending it on PYTHONPATH:
# that shadows any baked copy for imports + coverage, while the baked installs
# still supply the importlib.metadata surface (entry points, __version__) that
# a bare PYTHONPATH cannot.
#
# No install, no --writable-tmpfs: nothing is written into the SIF (the baked
# venv is root-owned — a runtime install hits Permission denied even on a
# tmpfs overlay).
#
# Fail-loud: a SIF without the baked venv is a hard error (rebuild the SIF) —
# never a per-run install fallback. A dep this package imports that is missing
# from the SIF is ALSO a hard error: bake it into the SIF (top up ci-cpu.def),
# never `pip install` it here.
